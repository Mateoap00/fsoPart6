# redux-anecdotes App

The redux-anecdotes app is the final version of the application developed between exercises 6.3 and 6.19. The app uses Redux Toolkit as state management and json-server to simulate a small database. The app shows a list of anecdotes alongside the total of votes a anecdote has and a button to vote for that specific anecdote. You can add new anecdotes using the small form and the app also has a "filter with" section to show a anecdote that includes the phrase you are using as a filter. Run `npm install`, `npm run server`, and `npm run dev` to run the app.
